# Daily Examen App

This application was built with the guidance of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, a language model AI developed by OpenAI. 

## About

The Daily Examen App is a simple web app that guides you through a daily spiritual reflection. The application records your responses locally in your browser's storage. The app can be used offline and is meant to be run locally on a user's machine, with all data stored on localStorage.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/garrettstephens11/daily-examen.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```
    cd daily_examen
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser:
    ```
    open index.html
    ```

    If you're on Linux, use `xdg-open` instead of `open`:

    ```
    xdg-open index.html
    ```

That's it! The application should now be running in your web browser.

## Using the App

To use the application each day and ensure your responses are logged correctly, you will need to open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 

For simplicity, you can do this each day from the terminal with the same command you used to open the file initially (`open index.html` or `xdg-open index.html` depending on your system).

Your responses will be stored in your browser's localStorage, so they'll be there even if you close the page or restart your computer.

Remember, your data is stored locally and not sent anywhere, so you maintain full control and privacy.
